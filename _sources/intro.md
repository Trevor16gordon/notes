# Intro

Welcome! I am currently in my first semester of my MS in Electrical Engineering at Columbia University with a focus in machine learning and reinforcement learning.

Please see my LinkedIn for information on my experience: https://www.linkedin.com/in/tgordon-ubc/

I will be using this jupyter book to keep high quality notes on my courses while at Columbia. This includes theory, formulas, code snippets and links to useful resources.
