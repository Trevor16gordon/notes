# Convolutional Neural Networks


## Convolution Basics


## Convolutional layer


## Pooling Layers



## Data Augmentation
- Increasing the training dataset by performing some operations to the input data
- Ex
  - Shifting images
  - Adding noise
  - Rotating images
  - Flipping images
  - Adding other filters


## Transfer Learning

- Making use of a model that was trained on a very large dataset for a different purpose. The model will likely still have useful training
- Use the first parts of the nework and retraining the final classification layer
