# Machine Learning for signals, information, data
This course provides an introduction to supervised and unsupervised techniques for machine learning. We will cover both probabilistic and non-probabilistic approaches to machine learning. Focus will be on classification and regression models, clustering methods, matrix factorization and sequential models. Methods covered in class include linear and logistic regression, support vector machines, boosting, K-means clustering, mixture models, expectation-maximization algorithm, hidden Markov models, among others. We will cover algorithmic techniques for optimization, such as gradient and coordinate descent methods, as the need arises.
