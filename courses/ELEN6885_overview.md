# Reinforcement Learning
Reinforcement learning (RL) is a computation approach to learning whereby an agent tries to maximize the total amount of reward it receives when interacting with a complex, uncertain environment. This course will introduce the mathematical theory of reinforcement learning and its applications to the design of human-level artificial intelligence. The objective of this course is to provide students with required knowledge to conduct research in reinforcement learning and basic skills to apply reinforcement learning techniques to real-world applications.
